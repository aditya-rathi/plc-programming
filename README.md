PLC Projects that I have completed

The projects that I have completed are the following:

5 Conveyer belt system with sequencing: PLC Ladder logic for a system of 5 conveyer belts where upon start the belts start in a set sequence and stop in the reverse sequence with the desired gap between them. 

2 Pump system with lead/lag and recirculation: Ladder logic for a redundant 2 pump chemical flow system with a recirculation valve that opens 10 seconds after the pumps starts and a lead lag logic to ensure load balancing between the 2 pumps

All project details are in the project documentation file in the respective folders
